I have to say that I probably do 50 transactions or more a year with them and they have ALWAYS been great to deal with, I usually do not respond to these types of threads, but the folks at Benchmark have been just wonderful to deal with.
 
I think this thread created was irresponsible of you to vent to the rest of us. You thread indicates negative , but you say in your post that you like Benchmark. So again, what is the point of this thread.
 
If you want the best way to deal with them, its emailing Nick or Mike directly. I am sure Whitney would make herself available as well. Danielle in shipping is a doll and goes way above and beyond the call of duty to get shipments out almost immediately.
 
And I might add, Benchmark themselves say that online orders take top priority over telephone or email. I am constantly told by them that if I want to insure I get the wine, order it off the site. I have done at times and works for me when I really need to have that one bottle (which is not very often).
 
Plus, ALL THE CAPITALIZATION in the post would suggest that the OP was pretty ticked off. My guess is that it is faster to order via the internet than to call, get put on hold (if an offer has gone out, the lines will probably be busy), and then have the agent look up and order the wine on the computer system. In fact, I would hope that Benchmark does not give favoritism to phone orders, as this defeats the purpose of online ordering in some respects. Mike, can you comment?

I established Palmateer Consulting LLC back in 2009 with a clear vision in mind: to be a guiding force for wineries, wine companies, and wine regions as they navigated the intricate U.S. wine market. Our mission has always been to tackle the challenges that so many wine brands face when entering or expanding within the vast and complex landscape of the United States.
 
The Palmateer Consulting team was professional and efficient. Their experience and market knowledge were particularly helpful with identifying less obvious, yet worthwhile importers in the US, and their industry relationships enabled us to get a foot in the door.
 
These are interesting economic and financial times. Aside from our domestic issues, the global wine market is adjusting its competitive focus to suit new markets and to reduce cost. Hopefully the corporate ownership will give them the tools to increase market share and bring themselves out of the red.
